# Twitter Webhook for Travis CI [[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamesseanwright/travis-twitter-webhook.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesseanwright/travis-twitter-webhook)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesseanwright/jamesswright.co.uk)

Just a quick project using TDD to post Travis CI Webhook notifications to Twitter. Will update this README with instructions once it's done.

## Unit Tests
Run `npm i` and then `npm test` as per usual.
